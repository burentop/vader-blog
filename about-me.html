    <img src="img/vader.jpg" alt="A picture of me." />
    <p>I was born on the outskirts of College Station, TX. I had about 8 or 9 brothers and sisters. My master came to pick me up one day, and I never saw
       my siblings again. My master was very awesome, and I enjoyed constant vittles and walks in the woods. If I had it to do all over again, I would eat
       less of my own poop.</p>
